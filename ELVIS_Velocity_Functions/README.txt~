Type "python velocity_function.py" and follow the prompts to save the files
This program does the following for both, isolated and paired halos 
	- Finds galaxies across the ELVIS Halo Catalog that belong to the following stellar mass ranges: 
		- range 1: 1.e7 Msun - 3.e7 Msun
		- range 2: 1.e8 Msun - 3.e8 Msun
		- range 3: 1.e9 Msun - 3.e9 Msun
	- Finds the satellites of the hosts beloning to the 3 ranges
	- Creates a velocity function for the satellites of 2 random hosts belonging to each range 
		- Saves this hostogram as a .png file in the respective 'Range' folder
	- Creates a stacked velocity function for all the ranges 
		- Saves histogram as a .png file
	- Creates a comparison of the velocity function of each range
		- Saves histogram as a .png file
	- Creates a comparison of the velocity function of satellites with Mstar < 1.e5 and > 1.e5 by range
		- Saves histogram as a .png file
	- Separates satellites with apeak < 0.5 and > 0.5 by range
		- Saves this data as two separate .txt files
	- Generates satellite data for each range
		- Saves this data as a .txt file
	- Generates satellites in one of 4 ways:
		- Through PID/UpID
		- Through distance
		- Each of the above with Vpeak > 12 km/s
